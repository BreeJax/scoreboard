# Score Board

For this assignment, you will be creating a simple interactive scoreboard for your favorite sport.

## Requirements

* Refer to this mockup to design your page:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/master/curriculum/fundamentals/javascript/assignments/assets/scoreboard.png

* Use the HTML and CSS [here](https://gist.github.com/mdewey/d331c0a449b8e53b4adc472ec0e5a1e8) to jump-start your project.
* A user should be able to update a score and the teams playing.

### Explorer Mode

* [ ] Create a new project and implement the design using the given HTML & CSS.
* [ ] Assign click events to the `update` buttons to update the corresponding values on the page. The score buttons should adjust the current score by a "hard-coded" value.
* [ ] Deploy your site.

### Adventure Mode

* [ ] Implement a Quarter/Period Tracker that would be appropriate for the sport.
* [ ] Add some styling to make it more presentable. Have fun with it.
* [ ] Make the layout responsive.

### Epic Mode

* [ ] Add a Timer that counts down automatically and updates the period/quarter appropriately.
* [ ] Save/load the information to local storage.
* [ ] Add CSS to the winning teams score to indicate who is currently winning.
* [ ] Add anything else that your sport would have on its scoreboard (e.g. fouls, sacks, shots on goal, etc.).
* [ ] Improve the UX to help to make score keeping by your sport easier.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
